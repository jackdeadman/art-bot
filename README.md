# art-bot

##Usage

In order to create a freeform feel to the artBot, the virtual pen moves at a constant speed. The curvature of the lines can be adjusted through keyboard input or on-screen gaze elements.

the curvature of the line cae adjusted while the virtual pen is moving or stopped.

Starting and stopping the virtual pen will allow for finer grain control than constantly adjusting as the virtual pen moves.

###Circle Control Lement

The incremental circles adjust the curvature of the line drawn by the virtual pen. With the centre circle '0' deawing a straight line. 1-4 increasing curvature to the right and -4 - -1 increase curvature to the left.

The circular control elements are all activated through gaze, so no clicking is required.

If the virtual pen is moving, gazing at 1 would slightly curve to the right. Then gazing at any other control curcylar would adjust the direction accordingly. The virtual pen will only stop moving when you gaze on the 'stop' bar on the left hand side.

The direction of the virtual pen can also be adjusted while the pen is stopped. To do this gaze on the desired direction, then gaze at start. The virtual pen will always move in the direction of the last gazed control circle.

The currently active  direction is highlighted green.

The drawing canvas can be cleared by clicking the 'reset' button. This is the only interface button that requires a mouse click.

###Keyboard Input

to start and stop the virtual pen press 'space'.

to clear the canvas and reset the virtual pen position press 'return'.

to move the virtual pen in a straight line press 6.

Numbers 7,8,9,0, increase the curvature of the virtual pen to the right of the canvas. With each number increasing the curvature in ascending value, with 0 the highest.

Numbers 5,4,3,2increase the curvature of the virtual pen to the left, with descending values increasing the curve.
